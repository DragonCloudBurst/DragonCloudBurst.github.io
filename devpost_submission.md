## Inspiration
- The idea behind _Tasktronaut_ is that it would be used as a planner of sorts by the user.
- Concepts of visual customization as a reward for the user were vaguely inspired by the web application [_Endless Garden_ by Ori](https://github.com/OriWritesAPlugin/EndlessGarden).
- This year's space theme was a big inspiration for our app's theme, name, and appearance.

## What it does
- The application contains a timer, which can be used either separately or individually from the task-tracking feature. For example, you could use the timer to challenge yourself to get a task done within a certain time limit. Alternatively, you could simply use it to make a reminder to wash the dishes. Anything goes.
- _Tasktronaut_ lets the user manually create their own tasks by entering in a name, then either pressing "add" or hitting the enter key. These tasks can be checked off by clicking on the box they're in, as well as deleted by hitting the 'x' in the upper-right-hand corner of the box.
- When a user checks off a task, they earn a credit. This credit will remain once the user deletes the task, but will be removed if the user unchecks the task. That way, a user can correct their mistake if they accidentally check off an unfinished task.
- Credits from completed tasks can be used to purchase different visual assets and elements in the app.

## Challenges we faced
- Ensuring that the timer is fully accurate, and that it updates visually.
- Making the user's credits transfer between pages.
- Implementing the graphic sizing.

## We're proud of:
- Getting the timer to work properly.
- The appearance of the graphics.
- The general aesthetic, function, and idea of the app.

## What's next:
- I (Kate Spivey) hope to continue development of _Tasktronaut_ at some point in the future. I feel like this concept has a lot of potential that, when fleshed out, could be something really special.
    - More customization options for the user
    - Improved HTML/CSS, neater file organization and structure
    - Animations
    - More sound effects
